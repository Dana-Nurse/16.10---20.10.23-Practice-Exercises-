# 16.10---20.10.23-Practice-Exercises-

**Overview**
This repository contains a collection of Python coding challenges that I've practiced from online sources like LeetCode and CodeWars. These challenges have been a valuable resource to reinforce my Python programming skills, improve my coding abilities, and gain a better chance of entering a coding bootcamp. It also serves as an effort to build my coding portfolio.

**Usage**
Feel free to explore the challenges, review the code, and provide feedback. You can run the Python scripts in your own environment to see the solutions in action.

**Contributions**
I welcome contributions and feedback. If you have ideas for new challenges, improvements, or optimizations, please don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request.
