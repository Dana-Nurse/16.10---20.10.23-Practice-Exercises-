#ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot
# contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.
#If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else false

#Best Practice:
def validate_pincw(pin):
    return len(pin) in (4, 6) and pin.isdigit()
#The in operator checks if the left operand (len(pin)) exists within the tuple (4, 6).
# It returns True if the length of pin matches either 4 or 6; otherwise, it returns False.

#and: The logical and operator combines the two conditions. It returns True only if both conditions on
# #its left and right sides are True; otherwise, it returns False


#MyCode
def validate_pin(pin):
    if pin.isdigit() and (len(pin) == 4 or len(pin) == 6):
        #By adding parentheses around the len it ensures that the part of the condtion is
        # still evaluated together after the pin.isdigit
         return True
    else:
        return False


print(validate_pin("-23456"))

#Implement a function that adds two numbers together and

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.
